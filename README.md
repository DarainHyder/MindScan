## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Clone and Setup

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir mental-health-ml
cd mental-health-ml

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Download Dataset

**Option A: Kaggle Reddit Mental Health Dataset (Recommended for Quick Start)**

1. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health
2. Click "Download" (requires free Kaggle account)
3. Extract the CSV file
4. Place it in: `data/raw/mental_health.csv`

**Option B: DAIC-WOZ Dataset (Clinical interviews with PHQ scores)**

1. Go to: https://dcapswoz.ict.usc.edu/
2. Click "Request Access" and fill out the form
3. Wait for email with download link (1-2 days)
4. Download and extract to: `data/raw/daic_woz/`

### Step 3: Create Directory Structure

```bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p data/raw
mkdir -p data/processed
mkdir -p models
mkdir -p outputs/figures
mkdir -p notebooks
mkdir -p src
```

### Step 4: Preprocess Data

```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```

This will:
- Load the raw dataset
- Clean and anonymize text
- Remove noise (URLs, usernames, etc.)
- Save processed data to `data/processed/`

### Step 5: Run Exploratory Data Analysis (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python notebooks/01_eda.py
```

This generates visualizations in `outputs/figures/`:
- Label distribution
- Text length analysis
- Top n-grams per class
- Word frequency analysis

### Step 6: Train the Model

**Option A: Train Baseline Model (Fast, CPU-friendly)**

```bash
python src/train_baseline.py
```

Training time: ~5-10 minutes on CPU

**Option B: Train Transformer Model (Better accuracy, needs GPU)**

```bash
python src/train_transformer.py
```

Training time: ~30-60 minutes on GPU, several hours on CPU

⚠️ **Note**: If training transformer on CPU, you'll be prompted to confirm.

### Step 7: Test the Model

```bash
python src/inference.py
```

This will run test predictions on sample texts.

### Step 8: Run the Web Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:5000**

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Switching Between Models

Edit `app.py` line 12:

```python
MODEL_TYPE = 'baseline'  # or 'transformer'
```

### Adjusting Prediction Threshold

Edit `src/inference.py` in the `__init__` method:

```python
self.threshold = 0.5  # Lower = higher recall, higher = higher precision
```

### Customizing Training

Edit hyperparameters in:
- `src/train_baseline.py` - lines 38-42 (param_grid)
- `src/train_transformer.py` - lines 63-75 (TrainingArguments)

## 📈 Understanding Results

### Risk Levels

- **Low** (0-30%): Minimal indicators of depression
- **Moderate** (30-60%): Some indicators present
- **High** (60-80%): Significant indicators present
- **Very High** (80-100%): Strong indicators present

### PHQ-9 Severity Levels

- **Minimal** (0-4): Little to no depression
- **Mild** (5-9): Mild depression symptoms
- **Moderate** (10-14): Moderate depression
- **Moderately Severe** (15-19): Moderately severe depression
- **Severe** (20-27): Severe depression

### Question 9 Emergency Flag

If PHQ-9 Question 9 (thoughts of self-harm) scores > 0, an emergency flag is raised and crisis resources are displayed prominently.

## 🔒 Privacy & Ethics

### Data Handling

- **Anonymization**: All usernames, emails, and personal identifiers are removed
- **No Storage**: Web app doesn't store user inputs by default
- **Consent**: Always get explicit consent before storing any text data
- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS in production

### Ethical Considerations

1. **Not a Diagnosis**: Emphasize this is a screening tool, not diagnostic
2. **Professional Referral**: Always recommend consulting licensed professionals
3. **Crisis Response**: Implement immediate crisis resource display for high-risk cases
4. **Bias Awareness**: Monitor for demographic disparities in predictions
5. **Transparency**: Explain how the model works to users

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No module named 'transformers'"

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch
```

### Issue: "CUDA out of memory" during transformer training

Reduce batch size in `src/train_transformer.py`:

```python
per_device_train_batch_size=8,  # instead of 16
```

### Issue: Model file not found

Make sure you've trained a model first:

```bash
python src/train_baseline.py
```

### Issue: Dataset not loading

Check that your CSV is in the correct location:
- For Kaggle: `data/raw/mental_health.csv`
- For DAIC-WOZ: `data/raw/daic_woz/`

### Issue: Flask port already in use

Change port in `app.py` line 461:

```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)  # changed from 5000
```
